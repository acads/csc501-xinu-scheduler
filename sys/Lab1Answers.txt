1. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each of the two scheduling 
   policies? Also, give the advantages and disadvantages of the round robinss le 
   scheduling policy originally implemented in Xinu.

Xinu scheduler
Advantages
    * Very easy to implement as if follows a simple "higher priority first"
      algorithm.
    * Very minimal context switching time as the context switching code just
      has to schedule the next process with the highest priority.
    * Best suited for non real-time embedded systems.
Disadvantages
    * Process startvation and unfairness - Xinu scheduler always favors the
      the processes with higher priority. Thus it would lead to starvation of
      lower priority processes.
    * Kernel cannot preempt a higher priority process that have stuck in an
      infinite loop.
      
Random scheduler
Advatages
    * Ensures fairness (no starvation between processes) among processes. i.e.,
      all the processes in the ready queue would get a chance to be run.
    * Even while acheiving fairness, it favors higher priority processes by
      selecting them with a higher probability than that of a lower priority 
      process.
Disadvantages
    * Process scheduling is somewhat unpredictable due to the high degree of
      randomness involved in selecting which process is to be run.
    * Requires more memory than that of Xinu scheduler as it involves three
      different queues.
    * Requires more time to context switch when compared to that of Xinu 
    scheduler.
    
Linux-like scheduler
Advantages
    * Best among the three as it ensures fairness among all processes at the 
      same time schedules higher priority processes more frequently and with 
      more CPU time.
    * Processes CPU time is based on how nicer they are to other processes and 
      also based on the priority of the process.
Disadvantages
    * Very complex to implement as it has many parameters to consider - goodness,
      per process CPU time and so on.
    * Time being spent on context switching is more as it has to recalculate the
      CPU time during every context switch, select a process with a higher 
      goodness during every process switch and finally recalculate goodness 
      at the end of an epoch.
    * Requires more memory as it has to store additional information such as
      per process CPU time and per process goodness.

2. Describe the way each of the schedulers affects the NULL process.
    In all the cases the null process is run only when there are no other
    runnable processes (processes that are on ready queue) to run.
